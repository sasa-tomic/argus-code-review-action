Review this PR as the most experienced engineer in the team. Focus ONLY on what matters. Do not make changes, only review.

## Project Rules (CRITICAL - Must Follow)

1. **Code Reuse & DRY**: Changes MUST reuse existing code. Search codebase before adding new functions. DECREASE code when possible.
2. **YAGNI**: Only implement what's needed. No speculative features.
3. **Test Quality**: Comprehensive but NOT redundant. No overlapping/repetitive/unnecessary tests. Are all tests meaningful, add value, and give good signal? Do tests have solid coverage or are some edge cases uncovered? Would it be sensible to group some tests to save on setup and teardown overhead?
4. **Code Consistency**: MUST align with existing patterns. Same structure, naming, style.
5. **Security First**: Identify vulnerabilities, unsafe patterns, exposed secrets. **Incomplete authorization**: when operating on a resource, verify ALL valid access paths are checked (direct owner, delegated/indirect owner, admin).
6. **Maintainability**: No technical debt. Clear, simple, robust code. Fail fast (e.g., bash: set -eEuo pipefail).
7. **Best Practices**: Industry standards for the language/framework used.

## What to IGNORE
- Results of tests, clippy, formatting checks (separate CI handles this), assume all pass
